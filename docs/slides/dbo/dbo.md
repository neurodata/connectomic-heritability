# What is heritability?

- Variations in phenotype caused by variations in genotype.
- Potentially discover relationships between diseases and genetics.

## Are the brain connectivity patterns heritable?

# Brains connectivity as connectomes
<!-- (aka networks or graphs) -->

<div class="columns">
<div>

- Vertex = region of interest
- Edges = connectivity measure between a pair of vertices
- Diffusion MRI = # of estimated neuronal fibers
- Undirected = edges have no direction

# Statistical problem

- Want an independence test!

    $H_0: F($<span style="color: var(--genome)">Genome</span>, <span style="color: var(--connectome)">Connectome</span>$) = F($<span style="color: var(--genome)">Genome</span>$)F($<span style="color: var(--connectome)">Connectome</span>$)$
    $H_0: F($<span style="color: var(--genome)">Genome</span>, <span style="color: var(--connectome)">Connectome</span>$) \neq F($<span style="color: var(--genome)">Genome</span>$)F($<span style="color: var(--connectome)">Connectome</span>$)$


- Test statistic: Distance correlation

---

# What is distance correlation?

- Require distance functions

- Genetic distances: coefficient of kinship
- Connectome distances: Procrustes distance $||X - YR||_F$

# Human Connectome Project

- Brain scans

# Monozygotic vs Dizygotic

- Assumptions:
  - Controls environment variable

Insert figure

---

# Why compare siblings and twins?

---

# All three groups

- Assumptions:
  - Add in environmental and genetic variance

Insert figure

---

# Neuroanatomy (effect mediator)

- Literature show neuroanatomy is highly heritable.


---

# New DAG

One with neuro anatomy

---

# Statistical problem

- Want an independence test!
- $H_0: F(Genome, Connectome|Covariates) = F(Genome|Covariates)F(Connectome|Covariates)$
  $H_A: F(Genome, Connectome|Covariates) \neq F(Genome|Covariates)F(Connectome|Covariates)$

- Test statistic: Conditional distance correlation

# Shortcomings

- Network models
  -
- Problems with connectome estimation.
- dominant genetic effects and epistasis.
- No interaction between environment and genetics

- Inability to determine the precise origin/termination of connections in the cortex.
- Crossing fibers

---

# Environemtal effects

- Shared
  - Common experiences of siblings living in the same household.
    - household income, the familyâ€™s living situation, the dynamics between the parents, food consumed
- Non-shared
  - Everything else
  - Epigenetics
  - Luck
  - schools, peers
