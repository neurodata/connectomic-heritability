# What is heritability?

- Variations in phenotype caused by variations in genotype.
- Example:

---

# Brains as connectomes
(aka networks or graphs)

- Vertex = a region of interest
- Edges = connectivity measure between a pair of vertices
- Diffusion MRI = # of estimated neuronal fibers

---
# Connectome Generation

# Statistical problem
- Want an independence test!
- $H_0: F(Genome, Connectome) = F(Genome)F(Connectome)$
  $H_A: F(Genome, Connectome) \neq F(Genome)F(Connectome)$

# Shortcomings
- Network models
- Problems with connectome estimation.
- dominant genetic effects and epistasis.
---

# Environemtal effects
- Shared
  - Common experiences of siblings living in the same household.
    - household income, the familyâ€™s living situation, the dynamics between the parents, food consumed
- Non-shared
  - Everything else
  - Epigenetics
  - Luck
  - schools, peers
