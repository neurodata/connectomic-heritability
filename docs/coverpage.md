# Abstract

A connectome is a map of the connections in the brain, and the degree to which the connectivity patterns may be constrained by environment and genetics is only beginning to be understood. Here we ask whether the connectivity patterns of the human brain are heritable. Network analysis methods have been used to study many areas of neu- roscience, such as neurodevelopment of adolescents and neurodegenerative diseases. However, current analysis methods are sometimes insufficient due to either a lack of interpretability or assumptions that are often violated in connectomics data. Using statistical models for networks, we develop semi-parametric procedures to quantify dissimilarities in connectomes and test whether the dissimilarities are dependent on familial relationships. To illustrate, we apply the procedures to connectomes estimated from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) diffusion data. We demonstrate that the connectomes are heritable; that is, that the similarities in connectomes are dependent on familial relationships. We then show that while the potential confounding anatomical features, such as brain volume, are heritable, connectomes remain heritable after suitably adjusting for the anatomy. Lastly, we illustrate that the subgraphs composed of the non-heritable vertices still form connectivity patterns that are heritable. Our findings indicate that genes play a strong role in shaping the connectivity of the human brain.
