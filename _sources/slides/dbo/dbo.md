  - Dataset
  - Results 1
  - Results 2
  - Results 3

# What is heritability?

- Variations in phenotype caused by variations in genotype.
- Potentially discover relationships between diseases and genetics

Are the brain connectivity patterns heritable?

---

# Brains connectivity as connectomes

(aka networks or graphs)

- Vertex = a region of interest
- Edges = connectivity measure between a pair of vertices
- Diffusion MRI = # of estimated neuronal fibers
- Undirected = Edges have no direction

# Statistical problem

- Want an independence test!
- $H_0: F(Genome, Connectome) = F(Genome)F(Connectome)$
  $H_A: F(Genome, Connectome) \neq F(Genome)F(Connectome)$

- Test statistic: Distance correlation

---

# Statistical problem

- Want an independence test!
- $H_0: F(Genome, Connectome|Covariates) = F(Genome|Covariates)F(Connectome|Covariates)$
  $H_A: F(Genome, Connectome|Covariates) \neq F(Genome|Covariates)F(Connectome|Covariates)$

- Test statistic: Conditional distance correlation

---

# Distance Correlations

- Require distance functions

- Genetic distances
- Connectome distances $||X - YR||_F$

# Monozygotic vs Dizygotic

- Assumptions:
  - Controls environment variable

Insert figure

---

# Why compare siblings and twins?

---

# All three groups

- Assumptions:
  - Add in environmental and genetic variance

Insert figure

# Neuroanatomy (effect mediator)

Test the existence of arrow

# Information on Distance Correlation

---

# Shortcomings

- Network models
- Problems with connectome estimation.
- dominant genetic effects and epistasis.
- No interaction between environment and genetics

---

# Environemtal effects

- Shared
  - Common experiences of siblings living in the same household.
    - household income, the familyâ€™s living situation, the dynamics between the parents, food consumed
- Non-shared
  - Everything else
  - Epigenetics
  - Luck
  - schools, peers
